  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it
  except <i>a tiny golden key</i>, and Aliceâ€™s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the
  hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not
  open any of them. <b>However</b>, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed
  before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the
  lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
