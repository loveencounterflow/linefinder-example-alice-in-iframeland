<!--
  Note:
  The problem with this implementation, specifically the use of pseudo elements to make the Switch UI, is that the UI itself is split down the middle in where a user can click to toggle the current selection.

  Ideally, the text "on" or "off" could be clicked to update the selected option...but it'd be nicer if the full toggle UI could also be clicked to toggle the options back and forth.  I'm sure this could still be done with this implemetnation, but as it stands right now, it doesn't fully allow that.
